A recent study from the Nebraska Department of Economic Development revealed that Nebraska’s geographic center in the U.S. gives it a great advantage for transportation, warehousing, logistics and distribution projects across the world. Today supply chain and logistics management companies are discovering what railroads and trucking firms have long known: that Nebraska is strategically located in the center of the country. Interstate 80, one of the nation’s busiest transportation routes, stretches from one end of the state to the other, in all, 482 miles. Seven national highways run north-south across the state, making Nebraska an ideal location for companies looking for access in the NAFTA trade corridor. The state also is served by two Class 1 rail systems.",
